# Installing Ruby

Ruby can be installed in Linux, MacOS, and Windows. There are
some methods to do it:

- download precompiled binaries.
- download Ruby through your OS package manager.
- build from source.

As a major goal for me, I built Ruby 3.2.2 from source code. This is the latest stable version. However, CRuby often backports bug fixes, security fixes, and sometimes performance improvements to stable LTS versions. But for now I'll stick to the stable LTS, though in the future I could build the latest 3.2 branch from Github or the offical Ruby website, in order to take advantage of improvements.
